## Overview
OVERVIEW TEXT
The purpose of the analysis is well defined.

## Results

### WHO & WHEN: Usertypes and weekdays
Analysis of a customer's bikesharing adventure begins with the "who" and "when."  Bikesharing is much more heavily utilized by subscribers than by-ride customers, and is much more heavily utilized by men than women.  While Thurs. and Fri. are highest-use days, business is noticeably lighter on Sat., Sun, and Wed.  Consider pricing incentives for by-ride customers on lighter days to capitalize on the bike "fleet" when subscriber use is lite, as well as encourage repeat business (e.g., rent a bike Saturday full-price, rent a bike Sunday for half).

### WHO: Trips by gender
A deeper dive into customer patterns reveals that there are heavy-use times in the evening hours of Thurs. and Fri.  More illuminating in this visual are the time trends.  Heavy-use times for men and women appear nearly identical, and the 7-10 am/5-8 pm hours are consistently popular across nearly all days, with notable dips on Sun. and Wed.

### WHEN: Trips by weekday
Analysis of the highest-traffic stoptimes reveals that bikers are ending trips concurrently with other bikers starting them—that is, when things are busy, outgoing/incoming bikes are likely to be crossing paths.  Taking measures to mitigate this potential pain point for customers during these busy hours is highly recommended.

### WHERE: Top starting locations
In the example, waterfront starting points appear to be highly desired by customers, and the popularity of a site generally decreases as it gets farther from the water.  This suggests that scenic geographic features are strong predictors of the popularity of the experience; site will be important to customers.

### HOW LONG: Trip duration
Trips are generally shorter than longer, with the most popular trip duration being 5 min.  This suggests that, while there is a clear “tourist appeal” for bikesharing, there is also a robust market for simple and quick transportation.  Also notable is the fact that virtually no riders use the service for longer than an hour.

### HOW LONG: Trip duration by gender
While use by men is clearly higher in this graph as well, behavior patterns between men and women are virtually identical:  high-use times for men are the same as high-use times for women.  Stamina for both genders seems to dip around 45 minutes into the trip.

### WHERE: Top ending locations
Just as there are consistently busy times whether bikers are incoming or outgoing, there are consistently busy locations.  This graph shows the potential for add’l customer pileup in these key areas at the busiest times.

### MAINTENANCE: Bike use and repair
There is inconsistent use across the bike fleet.  There are bikes with nearly 500 uses, as well as bikes with fewer than 10 uses.  Presumably the older bikes are aging out, and the majority of bikes in the fleet are in the middle of their lifespan or newer.

## Summary
There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
  Box plot for bike use to assess the current condition of the fleet.
  Cut time and stopping/starting locations—we should be able to analyze time on these maps (maybe a filter)
  Figure out tourists vs workers
